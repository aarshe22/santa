Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas everyone!

Now listen up, my festive friends, because Santa has a very important mission for you tonight.
You’re about to play the legendary Left-Right Christmas Gift Shuffle.

Here’s how it works.
When you hear me finish a story segment, you will pass your gift exactly one time.
If I say LEFT, you pass your gift to the left.
If I say RIGHT, you pass your gift to the right.
No skipping, no peeking, and no holding on tighter than a reindeer on a rooftop!

Now I see some familiar faces here.
Aaron, you look like someone who reads the instructions carefully… most of the time.
Mike, remember — this is not a race, even if the gift looks good.
Kat, I know you’re paying attention… Santa always knows.
Mark, absolutely no testing experimental features during the game.
Joseph, if something breaks, we all know who Santa is calling.

Most importantly, everyone keep your hands moving, your spirits high,
and remember — wherever your gift ends up, that’s exactly where Santa intended it to be.

Now… let’s begin!
Ho ho ho ho ho!
